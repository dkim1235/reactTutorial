so I watched a video about git branch. What i realized was what I was missing was that knowledge. 
I think i know what happened and why I hit my problems. 
I will be using git branch frequently to get used to git branching. 
It's not currently done with my current work place

create new branch:
git branch <new-branch-name>

rename branch:
git branch -m <new-name>

publish branch:
git push -u origin <local-branch>

merging branches:
git switch main
git merge <branch>
