what I've realized from this exercize is to continue lifting states up to a higher level of hierarchy to make the most effective use of re-usability and simplicity.
from storing data to the squares to the board to the game itself. 
When first creating your template it's okay to initially start with data at the base-most state, but it's important to consider scalability and lifting states up continuously.
