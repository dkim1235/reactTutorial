I feel like I have a hard time working on this project because I feel like there is no end to it.
Of course there is no end to the project, but I think it'll do me well when I have a goal in mind to achieve. 
Once I achieve it, I'm allowed to take a break.
I want to set relaxed goals, but I want to be able to hold myself to them.
I want to set a goal to finish the tutorial by 2023.01.27 before Ivan's cabin trip.
