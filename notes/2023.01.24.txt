I finished the react tutorial. 
I feel like I have a good grasp of what react can do. 
It's amazing compared to the express routes, and html/css I had to manage with the traditional bootcamp that I had to follow.
It allows FE engineers to focus on the FE instead of managing the routes.
It gives the ability to leverage instantiation.
It removes the need for EJS. 

So far overall it gives me a look into what this technology has provided.
ultimately all react is a wrapper. 
A really well documented and valuable wrapper. 
It helps me understand the value prospect of tradeoffs in lower level knowledge base and wrappers that help an individual contributer to focus on the task at hand.

Some things to ask when writing a wrapper:
1. how does this wrapper create value to the user
2. does the user need to know what is going underneath the hood of the wrapper?
3. how often does the user need to dig underneath the hood of the wrapper?
4. think more about workflows and ease of use.
