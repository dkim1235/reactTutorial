I had a lot of trouble creating a git for this project. 

The problem I had was trying to merge my newly created git in github and merging it with a locally created git.
I tried pushing the locally created git into the empty github and it caused a lot of problems.
I've hit this problem many times before. 

If I ever hit that problem again this is what you do:

1. log into github in the shell:
gh auth login

2. git init
git init -b main

3. git add
git add .

4. git commit
git commit -m "<comment>"

add remote origin from local git repository to the one made on github website
git remote add origin git@github.com:dkim1235/reactTutorial.git

set branch to be tracked because there was no tracking information with the branch.
this allowed branch master to track origin/main
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main master

rebase your repo to reconsile two divergent branches.
git config pull.rebase true

git pull
git pull and solve all merge conflicts

git rebase --continue
when satisfied with all of the changes fully rebase refs/heads/master


git push origin HEAD:main
